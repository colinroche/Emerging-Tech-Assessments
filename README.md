## The Mathamatics of Calculating the Square Root of Numbers
I decided to start my research on the the mathamatical aspect on calculating root numbers, what equations people have used in solving these and how this might help me better understand the optimal way to approach problem.
I thought it would be attentional to look at this problem form mutiple aspects including ideas that date back centuries to get a firm grasp on its fundentimentals which might show  how to code this in the most efficient way.
This includes the likes of the Babylonian method, dating back the Babylonian period and others mathimations take on the subject.
